# **Horilla CRM Opportunity Teams – Complete Functional Guide**

## **Introduction**

The Opportunity Teams module in Horilla CRM enables organizations to create collaborative sales teams for managing opportunities effectively. Each user with appropriate permissions can create and manage their own teams independently, providing flexibility and autonomy in team organization. By organizing team members with defined roles and access levels, users can ensure proper responsibility distribution, accountability, and streamlined communication throughout the sales process.

Opportunity Teams support role-based access control, allowing different team members to have varying levels of permissions (Read/Write access) based on their responsibilities. Each permitted user can build their own team structure, add members, and define access levels according to their specific needs. This ensures that the right people have the right level of access to opportunity information while maintaining data security and workflow efficiency.

## **Key Features and Functionalities**
