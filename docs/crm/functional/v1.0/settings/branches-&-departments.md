# **Horilla CRM Branch & Department Management – Complete Functional Guide**

## **Introduction**

The Branch & Department Management module in Horilla CRM allows organizations to manage multiple business units and their internal structures under a single system.

Each branch (company) can store its own company details, localization settings, and operational configurations while still being integrated into the wider CRM. Departments within branches provide a clear hierarchy and alignment between teams, enabling streamlined reporting and access management.

Branch (company) creation also triggers streamlined lead and opportunity stage configuration, ensuring that each branch (company) has its own tailored sales processes right from the start. This feature supports organizations with multi-location operations, enabling flexible customization for sales pipelines, departmental organization, and reporting.
