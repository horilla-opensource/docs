# Asset

The [asset module](https://www.horilla.com/features/asset/) is a key feature of our HRMS that enables employees to request and manage assets, such as computers or equipment, needed for their work. The system categorizes assets by type and tracks requests until they are approved and made available to the employee. With easy asset categorization, employees can quickly find the resources they need, and administrators can manage and allocate resources more efficiently. Overall, our Asset Management System is a powerful tool for organizations to manage and track assets in a streamlined and effective manner.

This layout is designed to improve the efficiency of asset management processes by organizing assets by category and making it easier for users to locate specific assets or groups of assets. Each asset has an individual view showing its details and edit or delete the asset as shown below,
